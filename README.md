# Prompt-Answer AI Project

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered application that takes user input (a prompt) and generates a meaningful response using OpenAI's GPT model. The application is designed to start simple, but the structure allows for continuous advancements and new features over time.

## Features

- **Prompt Input**: Accepts natural language prompts from the user.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Generates intelligent and context-aware responses using OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Customizable API Calls**: Set parameters like temperature and model version.
- **Scalable Design**: Built with a foundation that allows for incremental feature additions and improvements.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/PromptAnswerAI.git
   cd PromptAnswerAI
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Your OpenAI API Key**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Input Your Prompt**:

   - The program will prompt you to type your query. Example:
     ```
     Enter your prompt: What is the most used programming language?
     AI Response: The most used language is Python.
     ```
